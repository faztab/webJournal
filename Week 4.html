            <h2>Arrays</h2>
            <p>
                Explanation:<br>
                An array is a data structure that allows you to store a collection of elements of the same type. It is like a container that holds multiple values, and each value in the array is called an element. Arrays are commonly used in programming to store and manipulate large amounts of data efficiently.
            </p>
            <p>
                Arrays are usually stored in contiguous memory locations, which means that the elements are stored one after another in memory. Each element in the array is identified by its index, which represents its position in the array. The index starts from 0, so the first element of the array has an index of 0, the second element has an index of 1, and so on.
            </p>
            <h2>Examples</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>Example 1:</strong> int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};<br>
                <em>This example creates an array of integers called "numbers" with 5 elements. The elements of the array are initialized with the values 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Example 2:</strong> String[] names = new String[3];<br>
                names[0] = "Alice";<br>
                names[1] = "Bob";<br>
                names[2] = "Charlie";<br>
                <em>This example creates an array of strings called "names" with 3 elements. The elements of the array are initialized with null values. Then, the elements are assigned with the values "Alice", "Bob", and "Charlie" using their respective indexes.</em>
            </p>
            <h2>Analogy</h2>
            <p>
                Think of an array like a tray with compartments. Each compartment can hold an item of the same type. You can access the items in the tray by their position or index. For example, if you want to get the item in the third compartment, you would look at the third index of the array. Just like how you can add or remove items from the tray, you can modify the elements in an array by assigning new values to their corresponding indexes.
            </p>
            <h2>Misconception</h2>
            <p>
                A common misconception about arrays is that they can only hold a fixed number of elements. While arrays do have a fixed size when they are created, you can dynamically resize them in some programming languages. This means that you can add or remove elements from an array after it has been created. However, this resizing operation can be computationally expensive and may not be supported in all programming languages or environments.
            </p>
