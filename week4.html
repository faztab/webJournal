            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>
                Explanation:<br>
                A loop is a programming construct that allows you to repeat a set of instructions multiple times. It is a powerful tool for automating repetitive tasks and iterating over collections of data. There are different types of loops, but they all follow the same basic structure: a condition that is evaluated before each iteration, and a set of instructions that are executed repeatedly until the condition becomes false.
            </p>
            <p>
                The most common type of loop is the "for" loop. It consists of three parts: initialization, condition, and increment/decrement. The initialization is where you set the initial value of a control variable. The condition is checked before each iteration, and if it evaluates to true, the instructions inside the loop are executed. After each iteration, the control variable is incremented or decremented as specified in the increment/decrement part. This process continues until the condition becomes false.
            </p>
            <h2>Examples</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>Example 1:</strong> for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;System.out.println("Hello!");<br>
                }<br>
                <em>This example demonstrates a for loop that prints "Hello!" five times. The loop starts with an initialization of the control variable i with a value of 0. The condition i < 5 is checked before each iteration, and as long as it is true, the instruction System.out.println("Hello!"); is executed. After each iteration, the control variable i is incremented by 1.</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Example 
                <strong>Example 2:</strong> String[] names = new String[3];<br>
                names[0] = "Alice";<br>
                names[1] = "Bob";<br>
                names[2] = "Charlie";<br>
                <em>This example creates an array of strings called "names" with 3 elements. The elements of the array are initialized with null values. Then, the elements are assigned with the values "Alice", "Bob", and "Charlie" using their respective indexes.</em>
            </p>
            <h2>Analogy</h2>
            <p>
                Think of an array like a tray with compartments. Each compartment can hold an item of the same type. You can access the items in the tray by their position or index. For example, if you want to get the item in the third compartment, you would look at the third index of the array. Just like how you can add or remove items from the tray, you can modify the elements in an array by assigning new values to their corresponding indexes.
            </p>
            <h2>Misconception</h2>
            <p>
                A common misconception about arrays is that they can only hold a fixed number of elements. While arrays do have a fixed size when they are created, you can dynamically resize them in some programming languages. This means that you can add or remove elements from an array after it has been created. However, this resizing operation can be computationally expensive and may not be supported in all programming languages or environments.
            </p>
