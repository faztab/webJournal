        <h1>Coding:Loops</h1>
        <div style="background-color: #050206; padding: 20px;">
            <h2>Loops</h2>
            <p>
                Explanation:<br>
                A loop is a programming construct that allows you to repeat a set of instructions multiple times. It is a powerful tool for automating repetitive tasks and iterating over collections of data. There are different types of loops, but they all follow the same basic structure: a condition that is evaluated before each iteration, and a set of instructions that are executed repeatedly until the condition becomes false.
            </p>
            <p>
                The most common type of loop is the "for" loop. It consists of three parts: initialization, condition, and increment/decrement. The initialization is where you set the initial value of a control variable. The condition is checked before each iteration, and if it evaluates to true, the instructions inside the loop are executed. After each iteration, the control variable is incremented or decremented as specified in the increment/decrement part. This process continues until the condition becomes false.
            </p>
            <h2>Examples</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>Example 1:</strong> for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;System.out.println("Hello!");<br>
                }<br>
                <em>This example demonstrates a for loop that prints "Hello!" five times. The loop starts with an initialization of the control variable i with a value of 0. The condition i < 5 is checked before each iteration, and as long as it is true, the instruction System.out.println("Hello!"); is executed. After each iteration, the control variable i is incremented by 1.</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Example 2:</strong> int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for (int i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;System.out.println(numbers[i]);<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
                <em>This example demonstrates a for loop that iterates over an array called numbers and prints each element. The loop starts with an initialization of the control variable i with a value of 0. The condition i < numbers.length checks if the current index is within the bounds of the array. The instruction System.out.println(numbers[i]); prints the element at the current index. After each iteration, the control variable i is incremented by 1.</em>
            </p>
            <h2>Analogy</h2>
            <p>
                Think of a loop like a conveyor belt that moves items along a production line. The loop condition acts as a quality control check that determines whether an item should continue down the line. If the condition is met, the instructions inside the loop are executed, just like the machinery that performs operations on the items. After each iteration, the loop control variable is updated, just like the conveyor belt moves the items to the next station. The loop continues as long as the condition is true, just like the conveyor belt keeps running as long as there are items to process.
            </p>
            <h2>Misconception</h2>
            <p>
                A common misconception about loops is that they always run for a fixed number of times. While it is true that loops can be used for a predetermined number of iterations, they can also be used with conditions that depend on external factors or data. This allows loops to adapt to changing circumstances and handle different situations in a flexible manner. It is important to understand that the number of iterations can vary depending on the specific condition or data being used in the loop.
            </p>
